            Here’s a look at these states which have the highest number of active Covid-19 cases in India:

        <ul>
            <ol>
                1. Maharashtra: The southern state is the only one with more than 60,000 active Covid-19 cases in the
                country. It has reported 760,933 cases thus far. This means that active cases contribute 8.60% of
                Kerala’s total confirmed cases. Also, more than 3,000 people have succumbed to the disease in Kerala,
                the country’s fifth worst-hit state.
            </ol>
            <br>
            <ol>
                2. Kerala: With nearly 2 million Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra’s tally is nearly twice of the second
                worst-affected state, Karnataka. Active cases at 54,045 contribute 2.80% of the western state’s overall
                caseload.

            </ol>
            <br>
            <ol>
                3. Karnataka: The country’s most populous state, with a population of over 200 million, has reported
                nearly 600,000 Covid-19 cases till now. A total of 14,260 active cases means there are 2.43% active
                cases in the state currently.

            </ol>

            <br>
            <ol>
                4. Andhra Pradesh: The eastern state, whose handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has been a friction point
                between the Centre and the state government, has logged more than 550,000 cases thus far. A total of
                11,985 active cases contribute 2.17% of the state’s total Covid-19 cases.

            </ol>
            <br>
            <ol>
                5. Tamil Nadu: The central state has nearly 280,000 cases of Covid-19 of which 11,435 are active. This
                gives Chhattisgarh 4.09% active cases of its total tally.

            </ol>
            <br>
        </ul>
