                Thousands of new infections are being reported every day. Mumbai also has the highest number of
                new Corona cases reported so far. On the other hand, night curfew has also been implemented in the state
                to ban Corona.

                With Karnataka now reporting more than 2,500 Covid-19 cases a day, experts have warned that the second
                wave could be severe. Health minister K Sudhakar also expressed concerns about the surge on Saturday. As
                the number of Covid-19 cases surge in Bengaluru, more young children are turning positive.
